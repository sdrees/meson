## Added CompCert C compiler

Added experimental support for the [CompCert formally-verified C compiler](https://github.com/AbsInt/CompCert). The current state of the implementation is good enough to build the [picolibc project](https://github.com/picolibc/picolibc) with CompCert, but might still need additional adjustments for other projects.
