## The MSI installer is only available in 64 bit version

Microsoft ended support for Windows 7, so only 64 bit Windows OSs are
officially supported. Thus only a 64 bit MSI installer will be
provided going forward. People needing a 32 bit version can build
their own with the `msi/createmsi.py` script in Meson's source
repository.
